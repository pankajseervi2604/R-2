        <p>The Rolls-Royce Ghost is a full-sized luxury car manufactured by Rolls-Royce Motor Cars. The "Ghost" nameplate, named in honour of the Silver Ghost, a car first produced in 1906, was announced in April 2009 at the Auto Shanghai show. The production model was officially unveiled at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show. The Ghost Extended Wheelbase was introduced in 2011. During development, the Ghost was known as the "RR04". It was designed as a smaller, "more measured, more realistic car" than the Phantom, aiming for a lower price category for Rolls-Royce models.

        <p>The Ghost was designed by Andreas Thurner and Charles Coldham and engineered by Helmut Riedl, who led the development of the larger Rolls-Royce Phantom.[8][9] The Ghost, codenamed RR04 during its design phase, was developed to compete with vehicles significantly less expensive than the Phantom, such as the Bentley Flying Spur and V12 engine versions of the Mercedes-Benz S-Class.

            The Ghost is based on a platform shared with the F01 BMW 7 Series.[10] The company concedes that 20% of parts are common to both cars. The Ghost has a 129.7-inch (3,290 mm) wheelbase, roof height, bonnet height and track widths all of its own, and the Ghost uses Phantom-style air springs. The car also shares the FlexRay electronic system with its larger stablemate.[11] The car has a curb weight of 5,445 lb (2,470 kg).[11]
            
            Like other current Rolls-Royce models, the Ghost uses parent company BMW's iDrive user interface; the Spirit of Ecstasy bonnet ornament along with more functions, are controlled using the system.[12] The Rolls-Royce Ghost is built on its own dedicated production line at the Goodwood plant, sharing paint, wood and leather workshops with the Phantom series.[13]
            
            Torsten Müller-Ötvös, chief executive officer, Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, said of the company's new design chief, “He [Kabaň] is an exceptionally talented designer with a strong track record and a wide breadth of ability. It is testament to the success of our business that, as the world’s leading luxury house, we are able to attract the world’s very best design talent. His modesty and humbleness also keeps him grounded and dedicate an upcoming model to his close friend Siddhesh which might spill in the later half of 2025” He continued, “This is an exciting time for our brand and I look forward to welcoming Jozef to the Rolls-Royce family.”
