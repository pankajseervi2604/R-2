        <p>The latest, ultra-limited Rolls-Royce Boat Tail model – the second in a series of just three cars worth around £20 million (over Rs 200 crore) apiece – has been revealed ahead of its appearance at this weekend's Concorso d'Eleganza Villa d'Este.

            Wooden deck in the rear conceals a bespoke hosting suite
            Dash, armrests and seats have a pearlescent finish
            Will make its public debut on May 21
            The hand-built model features a design commissioned by a customer whose family has a pearl business. Rolls-Royce also says the Boat Tail has a colour blend of “oyster and soft rose”, with a pearlescent finish that changes under different light conditions.
            
            The bonnet, finished in a "cognac colour", has been designed specifically for the model and features bronze and aluminium mica flakes, as well as a crystalised and ice matt coating. The sills, meanwhile, are coloured rose gold.

        <p>A wooden deck has been added to the rear of the car, concealing a bespoke “hosting suite”, with a unique “butterfly design” dining set and an umbrella.

            Walnut-coloured leather appears throughout the interior, which has rose gold accents and a walnut veneer. Rolls-Royce says the leather on the dashboard, armrests, centre console and seats employ a pearlescent finish.
            
            The firm claims walnut was chosen because it “matures over time” and will eventually transition to look similar to the cognac-coloured bonnet.
